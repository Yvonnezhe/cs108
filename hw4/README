Part 1 is in Bank package
Part 2 is in HashCracker package
Part 3 is in TheCount package
Part 4 is in WebLoader package

Can run ">java Bank small.txt 1"

Last part(WebFrame and WebWorker files) is really tricky for me.
Their is probably race conditions or inappropriate usage of some patterns/Java mechanics
It seems fine but i cant check it, so will just move on and will maybe come back someday.
